# Package-Delivery-Optimization-Ai
Simulation of local package delivery optimization using simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. Assigns packages to vehicles with capacity limits, determines delivery routes, and minimizes total traveled distance. Includes parameter tuning, heuristics, GUI visualization, and performance analysis.
